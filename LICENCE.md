This is an experiment/exercise in building a composer package, and setting it up.  
You can look, but you cannot touch, run, analyse, lick or compile.  
I don't care enough to chase down bots (or anyone for that matter), but for the record: BAD BOT.  
This is scraping publicly available page's movie id's and review values, and does not use descriptions/posters/other metadata from IMDB.  
Please don't sue me.  
  
If you want to do this, get the official, commercial (IMDB api)[https://developer.imdb.com/].  
Consider this an unholy closed half-MIT licence.
